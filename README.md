1. Authenticate your Venmo account with your username.
2. Tipper will listen for your tweets where you `@` someone, have a `$`, and the hashtag `#tipper`.
3. If the above conditions are met, we'll pay the $ to the recipient's venmo account from yours. If the recipient has not authed her venmo with us, the payment will not be processed.
4. Similarly, if there is a tweet at you with `#tipper` and a `$`, then your Venmo will be paid :).
5. Max payment is $20! If you mention multiple people on the tweet, they will all get paid the amount you specified.
